## Project Document

### Title
**Backend Technology Exploration and Analysis**

### Overview
This project is designed to analyze and compare the performance and ease of development across different backend technologies using a standardized frontend. This approach will help identify the most efficient backend solution for a simple task management application.

### Objectives
- To develop a flexible frontend capable of interfacing with multiple backends.
- To implement and compare multiple backend technologies using Python with Flask, Go with Gin, and Node.js with both JavaScript and TypeScript using Express.
- To evaluate each backend in terms of performance, scalability, and ease of integration.

### Functional Requirements

#### Task Management
- **Task Creation**: Users can create new tasks with a title and description.
- **Task Editing**: Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Task Deletion**: Users can delete tasks.
- **Task Listing**: Users can view a list of their tasks.
- **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks based on their status (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, pending tasks).

#### User Authentication
- **User Registration**: New users can register for an account.
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in to the application.
- **Session Management**: Cookie based JWTs

### Technical Requirements

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Context API
- **Routing**: React Router

#### Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

#### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker for both development and production environments
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for managing multi-container environments

#### Backends
- **Python with Flask**: Focus on rapid development and ease of use.
- **Go with Gin**: Analyze performance and efficiency.
- **Node.js with Express (TypeScript)**: Evaluate type safety and backend structure.
- **Node.js with Express (JavaScript)**: Test for ease of setup and flexibility.

### Environment Setup

#### Development
- Dockerized environment with separate containers for frontend, backend, and database.
- Hot reloading for frontend and backend code changes.

#### Production (Temporary for Testing)
- Dockerized environment with separate containers for frontend, multiple backends (switchable), and database.
- Automated deployment scripts.
